# Solar System

Full MR model of a solar system. Scale of all bodies as well as their speed ratios are accurate. Information taken from reliable sources, such as [NASA's planetary fact sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/). This includes orbital velocity, orbital inclination, rotation period, and more. The solar system is surrounded by an asteroid field.

## Interactions

Users can distance grab planets with both hands. Once a planet is grabbed, the appropriate info UI will be shown, with some basic information about a planet. Two planets can be grabbed at the same time, for example Earth in right hand, Moon in left hand. After the planet is released, it will snap back to its appropriate position.

Users have a palm menu which allows them to adjust the rotation multiplyer for the entire solar system, including orbital rotation, as well as planet rotation period. Additionally, users can adjust the opacity of the passthrough layer.

Users can move around the scene (smooth locomotion) if they have controllers in their hands.
